                 Lucinda Coxon



             Based on the novel by

               David Ebershoff
              




<b>EXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920'S, DAY
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
PUNCH of the weather going at it...

<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>INT. WOMAN'S EYE
</b>
The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman's
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.


<b>INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING
</b>
A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -

<b>                     OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>           Don't you wish you could paint like
           that?

We pull out to see GERDA WEGENER'S brown eyes shift from deep      *
scrutiny of the painting to polite social focus as she takes
in an excited OLDER WOMAN.

<b>                     GERDA
</b>           I'm sorry...?

<b>                     OLDER WOMAN
</b>           I said, don't you wish you could
           paint like your husband? Really - you must
           be so proud...

The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
consider... Gerda's gaze travels across the well-dressed
gathering. Far off in a corner, there's an inner circle
where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -
RASMUSSEN, Einar's dealer.

<b>                     RASMUSSEN
</b>           They're all Veijle, where he grew
           up.

Gerda begins walking toward them through the throng...

                       RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
             And I don't say my client is
             the best landscape artist in
             Denmark... but, he is in the top
             one!

Einar cringes as the crowd laughs, delighted. An exotic-
looking woman with mischief playing on her full lips
approaches Gerda. This is ULLA FONSMARCK. They're friends.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>                 (a stage whisper)
             It's going very well.

<b>                        GERDA
</b>             Oh yes.   He'll be impossible.

The women LAUGH. As Gerda looks up, Einar looks across,
smiles, trapped in his corner. Gerda nods back, reassuring,
conspiratorial. Then Einar's pulled back into the select
circle and Rasmussen emits a ridiculous barking LAUGH.


<b>EXT. COPENHAGEN STREET, NIGHT
</b>
Gerda and Einar, arm in arm, LAUGHING. Gerda wears a
distinctively embroidered fine wool wrap. Their FOOTSTEPS
ring down the empty street. A patina of crystallised brine
coats doorways, windows, scintillating in the moonlight.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             And Rasmussen...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Oh, come on. Be kind.
             At least he agreed to see your work.


<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Only because he was drunk!

<b>                          EINAR
</b>             I know.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You were loving it!

<b>                          EINAR
</b>             I was not.

She mimics Rasmussen, his ludicrous excitement:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             "I don't say my client is the best
             landscape artist in Denmark..."

<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                    26/11/15
</b><b>                                                         3.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                        EINAR
</b>             "But..."

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             "He is in the top one!"

They LAUGH hard.     Someone calls from an upstairs window:

<b>                       MAN AT WINDOW
</b>             Hey - people are sleeping!

The window SLAMS. Gerda and Einar struggle to quieten down,
head for the dancing harbour lights - partners in crime.


<b>EXT. HARBOUR, NEXT MORNING
</b>
<b>- MAIN TITLES BEGIN -
</b>
Fishermen selling straight off the boats to early-rising
customers. Prices are loudly negotiated as the silver catch
still writhes and flaps. A city coming to life.


<b>INT. THE WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
</b>
Gerda carries in a breakfast tray. Einar sleeps. She observes
his face: long eyelashes, cheeks hollow in repose, delicate
lips. A little dog, HVAPPE, trots beside her. She puts down
the tray and throws back the bedcover. Einar blinks in the
light, surprised. He stretches, takes in the silhouetted
outline of his wife: tall, purposeful Gerda.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Do you know what time it is?

He smiles, sweetly suggestive of pleasure to come...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Time you came back to bed?

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             No - I'm ready to start work.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Draw down the blinds.

She holds back, teases a little.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I told you, I...

<b>                        EINAR
</b>             Gerda...

<b>                        GERDA
</b>             What?

<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
She takes him in, smiling up at her.     Shakes her head.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Your face... You think I can't resist
             you...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Do you want to resist me?

She approaches the edge of the bed, smiling herself now.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             No. But I'd like you to ask nicely
             so I don't feel such a pushover...

Einar reaches towards her.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...

He pulls her into bed... A skittish piano comes up as they
laugh, begin to make love. Continues over:


<b>EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COPENHAGEN OPERA HOUSE
</b>
Einar crosses the road, heads for the Opera House.


<b>INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR
</b>
Einar greets the doorman, THORBJORN.

<b>                          EINAR
</b>             Thorbjorn.

<b>                       STAGE DOORMAN
</b>             Mr Wegener.


<b>INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, ONE MONTH LATER, DAY
</b>
Einar walks between racks of clothes that hang in two tiers
so the ruffled and feathered hems of jewel-coloured gowns
brush his cheeks. An explicit sensual pleasure, which Einar
is conscious of but feels no need to investigate. He pauses.
The ARIA ceases, he hears women CHATTING, sometimes DROPPING
THEIR VOICES, emitting DIRTY LAUGHS, which make him smile and
wonder. A stolen intimacy. Einar spies on Ulla, below -

<b>                          ULLA (O.S.)
</b>             Tighter!

Ulla is being pulled into a corset by a DRESSER. Einar leans
forward for a better view... She spots him - is delighted,
breaks free for a moment.

</b>
                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Einar Wegener!

The DRESSER hands Ulla a robe to cover up, but:

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Oh don't worry about him - he's only ever
             had eyes for one woman.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             My guilty secret's out.

He smiles at her, indulgent.      She calls up to him -

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             So - when are you two going to breed me a
             godchild?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             You're an atheist.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             I'll reconsider.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             We're trying.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             Try harder. I've been waiting an eternity.
             Have you tried drinking raw eggs?

<b>                        EINAR
</b>             No.

<b>                        ULLA
</b>             Do it.   For my sake.

Einar shakes his head.     She's impossible and he adores her.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Anyway what are you doing in today? I
             thought you finished last week?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I wanted to check on the scrim for the
             storm scene. And give Gerda some space.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             Ah - she's got a shy one.

Einar nods, smiles.     Ulla prepares to resume her fitting.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             You know I'm next?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             So I heard.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                       ULLA
</b>             I won't be shy.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I should imagine not.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             Good God, she'll need all her colours for
             me!

They LAUGH and Ulla signals to the dresser to pull at the
corset once more, smiles in delighted anticipation of the
discomfort to come.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
</b>
MR FONNESBECH in a chair on a slightly raised dais. He is
formally dressed, somewhat stiff. The room is oppressively
still. Gerda looks up from her canvas, goes to adjust
Fonnesbech's arm. He is clearly affected by being touched,
embarrassed. She returns to the canvas. After an
uncomfortable couple of moments:

<b>                       FONNESBECH
</b>             I wanted to say... I appreciate our being
             alone today. I hope your husband doesn't
             mind.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Not at all. I could see his being here
             made you uncomfortable.

<b>                       FONNESBECH
</b>             It wasn't personal.

Gerda smiles.      Shakes her head - he shouldn't worry:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             It's not uncommon.

<b>                        FONNESBECH
</b>             Ah.

Fonnesbech's relieved.     Though he's left with questions.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             It's hard for a man to be looked at by a
             woman. Women are used to it, of course,
             but for a man...

Mr Fonnesbech begins to look wildly vulnerable.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             To... submit to a woman's gaze.   It's
             unsettling...

Fonnesbech nods, relieved - that's exactly it.

             Although I believe there's some pleasure to
             be had from it, once you...

She smiles mischievously.

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             ...yield.

Fonnesbech swallows, cheeks pinking.       Suddenly:

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             Sit!

Fonnesbech flinches.       The dog settles.   Fonnesbech exhales.

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             Good girl.

Gerda returns to work, eyes glinting at what she's revealed
in her sitter: finally getting somewhere.


<b>EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, MONTHS LATER
</b>
A CHINESE LAUNDRESS with a large wheeled cart makes her way
along the street, RINGING a pair of little BELLS as she goes.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
</b>
Einar quickly but carefully folds Gerda's chemise and puts it
in a bag of laundry, hurries to open the door...


<b>INT/EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, A MONTH LATER
</b>
Einar hands the bag to the laundress as she passes.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
</b>
Gerda at the mirror, putting on her lipstick. Einar comes
in, reacts, seeing her dressed up. She's self-conscious.

<b>                          GERDA
</b>             Well?

Einar can't help smiling at her implied self-criticism.

<b>                         EINAR
</b>             Perfect.    Almost.

He approaches, uses his thumb to gently blend away a smudge
of lipstick from her bottom lip. He nods. Perfect now.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             Good luck...

<b>EXT. BUSY COPENHAGEN STREET, DAY
</b>
Gerda carries her heavy portfolio, optimistic, brisk.


<b>INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, DAY
</b>
Rasmussen's face - a look of slight distaste. A sea of
Gerda's work, on the desk, the floor - competent but
uninspiring naturalistic depictions of society figures.

<b>                    RASMUSSEN
</b>          All portraits...

Gerda hesitates a beat, the fact being so self-evident.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          Is that bad?

<b>                    RASMUSSEN
</b>          Not per se, but... this kind of work is not
          really my...

He winces a little.   He has to end this:

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          Gerda... I don't think it would benefit
          either of us to show these.

A vein begins to throb in Gerda's neck.

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          It's not a judgement on your abilities - I
          agree with Einar: you could be a first
          class painter if you found the right
          subject matter.

It's the first time Gerda's heard this.     Her eyes shine,
stung, betrayed.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
</b>
Einar works, hears the door. Gerda brings in the portfolio,
sets it down, starts taking off her coat. Einar's tentative:

<b>                    EINAR
</b>          How was it?

<b>                      GERDA
</b>          Fine.

He waits for more, but nothing comes.

<b>                    EINAR
</b>          I finally mixed the right colour for the
          snow.

Gerda glances at the canvas, hostile.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Another view of Vejle. I don't know how
             you can paint the same thing over and over.

Einar misses a beat.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I suppose I just haven't finished with it
             yet.

Gerda heads towards the door.

                          EINAR (cont'd)
             Gerda..?

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Could you please not speak to Rasmussen
             about me again... My work is my business.
             Stay out of it.

But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming
emphatically behind her. Einar's left bewildered.


<b>INT. BEDROOM, DAY
</b>
Gerda's already regretting the exchange with Einar. She
unfastens her dress, pulls it off. There's a bloodstain in
her underwear. Damn! She breathes.


<b>INT. STUDIO, DAY

Einar working as Gerda reappears. She's composed now,
refocused, approaches her easel, organises her paints.      Einar
steals a look at her, but says nothing. Works on.
Eventually:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I have my period.

<b>                          EINAR (O.S.)
</b>             I'm sorry.

<b>                          GERDA
</b>             Are you?

She turns to find him approaching.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Of course I am... You know I am.

A moment of quiet intimacy between them. Gerda shies away,
returns to present concerns... her work...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Could you help me with something?

Einar's relieved to be able to help.

<b>                         EINAR
</b>             Anything.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
             again. Would you try on her stockings and
             shoes?

Einar's discomfort erupts in a laugh.       Is she serious?

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I'm just so behind. I don't know how I'll
             be finished in time for her opening...

But he cuts her off:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I'll do it. It's fine.

Gerda sets a shoebox and the stocking on the sitter's chair,
goes into the kitchen. Einar moves the box and stockings,
sits in the chair on the dais. The dog leaps up -

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No... no, not now Hvappe...

He pushes Hvappe down, tests the mesh of the stockings between his
fingers. He rolls up his trousers.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             He almost snagged this...

Gerda marvels at his delicacy. Scolds the dog:

<b>                         GERDA
</b>             Hvappe...

Gerda mixes paints.      Einar battles with the stockings.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             That's backwards...

He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat dewing
his forehead by the time he's rolled both to the knee. He
opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I saw these in the window of
             Fonnesbech's...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Smart aren't they?

<b>                       EINAR

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Well just do what you can.

He takes them out... Something catches in Einar's throat as
he pushes his toes into the shoe. Gerda's eyes are narrow as
she starts work. Einar looks down at his feet, partly
contained in the yellow suede, the disjuncture between the
body above and below the knee... he breathes... can't keep
his hands steady. Then:

                        GERDA (cont'd)
             No.   I need the dress.

They both look over to where Ulla's dress hangs. It is white,
weighted with beads at the hem and cuff. Beautiful.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Gerda, I'm not putting it on.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I haven't asked you to.

She get sit... lays it across him.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Would you just relax...? The sooner I
             start, the sooner I finish.

Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gently
down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work.

Einar's breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress
weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush at
his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beaded
cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of
Gerda's easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound of
the harbour, the wind in the ships' riggings. These combine,
fill his head... until:

<b>                       ULLA (O.S.)
</b>             Well hello, there!

Einar starts... Ulla's in the doorway, delighted, with a huge
bunch of lilies. She starts to LAUGH, and because it's Ulla,
Gerda LAUGHS also. The dog YAPS, excited, confused. Einar's
disoriented. Gerda sees this, stops laughing, but...

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Oh, don't worry my darling...

She hands the flowers to him, kisses him:

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             We're going to call you Lili...

</b>
Einar manages to laugh now as the dog runs BARKING in
circles, Ulla's delight banishing the day's frustrations.


<b>EXT. HARBOUR, NIGHT
</b>
There are lights on in the Widow House.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT
</b>
Gerda closes the book she's been reading, looks up to see
Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
his back. He's comfortable with this, but works on.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Such concentration. Sometimes when you're
             working, I think you're going to slip
             through the surface of the painting and
             vanish.

He smiles a little.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sink into the bog. Like your friend's kite
             when you were a boy.

<b>                        EINAR
</b>             Hans.   It was Hans' kite I crashed.

Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
             I couldn't believe he even let me
             have a turn...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             He's probably still sitting on a
             rock, sobbing his heart out.

Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
work, smiles.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             He's a dealer in Paris, peddling
             Old Masters to rich Americans.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Oh. So we don't need to worry
             about Hans.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             No we don't.

He takes her in.

<b>                       GERDA

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             That's okay. I've finished.

He kisses her.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             And don't worry, I won't disappear into the
             bog.

He widens his eyes, surprised at his own realisation:

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             The bog is in me, silly.

She pushes him off, LAUGHING.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Einar's in bed. Gerda pulls off her dress, looks round to
see him watching her as she lays her stockings over the chair
beside her dressing table.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             What?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?

She goes to take off her lace-edged slip, self-conscious now.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             That slip is new...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You're very observant.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Leave it on...

She hesitates, but Einar pulls back the sheet... Gerda keeps
the slip on, climbs in beside him. He strokes her body
through the silk...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             It's very pretty...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I might let you borrow it.

Einar shrugs, rising flirtatiously to the challenge.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I might enjoy that.

Gerda LAUGHS, and Einar kisses her.      She teases:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Oh really...? Is there something you'd like
             to tell me?

<b>                      EINAR
</b>             Why...? Is there something you'd like to
             know...?

His fingers trace, quivering, over her...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             No... I'm your wife.    I know everything.

Einar thrills, pulls her on top of him, a fresh passion,
fresh risk about their union.


<b>INT. COSTUME SHOP, LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
A champagne cork POPS. Ulla's triumphant first night. She's
on magnificent form, working the room. Gerda's portrait hangs
in pride of place. Gerda and Einar chat with a group that
includes their friends NIELS and ELSA. Ulla swoops in,
WHISPERS something in Gerda's ear. Gerda's eyes register
delight as she looks across at two young men on the other
side of the room.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Both of them...?

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             And at the same time!

Einar laughs.    Gerda shakes her head.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Married people are so delightfully easy to
             shock.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             We just pretend to be shocked because it
             encourages you.

<b>                       ULLA

<b>                       EINAR

<b>                       GERDA

Niels and Elsa hear this, tune in...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her
             ankles. An invitation to corruption.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I don't think anyone is likely to be
             corrupted by seeing my ankles.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I was.

The group laughs delighted by Einar's buoyant mood.

                       EINAR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             The first time we met, I was leaving the
             Academy, and she was on the steps,
             flaunting said ankles... And she
             propositioned me!

<b>                       GERDA

             I asked him out.

<b>                       ULLA

Einar scrutinises Gerda.

<b>                       EINAR

<b>                       GERDA

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I don't know...

She remembers, drawing Einar into the recollection.

             But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed
             him... and it was the strangest thing... it
             was like kissing myself.

A look between Einar and Gerda, a connection crackling.

<b>                       ULLA

<b>INT. BEDROOM, NIGHT

Einar comes in, Gerda's already in bed.    He starts to
undress, turns out the light.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Turn it back on.

He looks at her. She shrugs, smiles - it's her turn, after
all... He turns it back on, a little awkward now, undressing
in front of her. She sees this, toughs it out, watching him
anyway.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Were you really corrupted by my ankles?

Einar wears just his shirt now, begins to unbutton.

</b>             You were shameless.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I still am.

Einar peels off his shirt. Underneath, he wears Gerda's lace-
edged slip. Gerda GASPS slightly... Einar has outdone her
with this imaginative twist. But she rises to the occasion.
Feels the fabric against his body.

<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING

Einar asleep, a SCRATCHING sound in the background. We see
quick charcoal strokes on paper, Gerda wrapped in Einar's
dressing gown, at the side of the bed. She's fascinated,
suddenly able to see the femininity of his features, plays
with it, creating a revised Einar... His eyes open...

<b>                       GERDA

Gerda shrugs, keeps sketching.

</b>             Oh, I was always pretty, you just never
             noticed.

Gerda LAUGHS, keeps working.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, A WEEK LATER
</b>
In the studio, Einar looks at the sketches Gerda has made of
him, darkly fascinated. He hears Gerda come in.

<b>                          GERDA (O.S.)
</b>             Hello...?

<b>                          EINAR
</b>             In here...

Gerda comes in, puts down her workbag, takes off her coat.
Einar's still looking at the sketches. Gerda's a little self-
conscious...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             These are good.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Do you think?

He nods, absolutely serious. Gerda absorbs this, gratified.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Well thank you. Thank you.

Gerda goes out to hang up her coat, calls -

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I had coffee with Ulla. She asked
             about the Artists' Ball.

Einar draws breath to protest, but:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Don't worry - I told her no.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             You should go, you enjoy it.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             With you I enjoy it.

Einar feels guilty.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Look - it's good to be seen at those
             things. I understand that.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             And that's why you hate them.

Gerda shrugs - she gets it.       He smiles.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I feel as though I'm performing myself.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Giving them your Einar Wegener.

Exactly.   Gerda looks at him a moment.

             Why not give them something different, go
             as someone else?

She tilts her head. A look between them... this is a
departure... Einar hesitates a moment...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Did you have someone in particular in mind?

A mischievous smile spreads across Gerda's face... she starts
to laugh, Einar begins to understand... laughs along...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No - that's outrageous!

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You'd be very convincing...    You might even
             enjoy it...

Einar marvels at her... she's only half-joking.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, EVENING
</b>
Gerda sweeps a layer of foundation over Einar's face.         When
she's done, he opens his eyes. Gerda's taken aback.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You'll have to shave closer.

Einar takes in his blanked-out face in the shaving mirror.
Gerda goes to apply eyeliner...

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Close your eyes... This is hard on someone
             else...

<b>                         EINAR
</b>             Here...

Einar takes the crayon, draws a couple of pretty good lines.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             How's that?

She marvels at his reflection.      It's bizarrely compelling.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Better than I ever manage.

His reflection looks back. Gerda's energy is up...       She
drapes her scarf around his neck...

                         GERDA (cont'd)
             Oh, Lili!    I want to sketch you...

She hurries him through to the studio... arranges cushions on
the chaise.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sit!

Einar sits - a distinctive pose.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Come on, Hvap!

Hvappe jumps onto his lap. Gerda sketches quickly, absorbed,
excited. She rearranges him, `feminising' his poses.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Knee over... head up.. Look at
             those hands... relax...

We see Einar at a series of angles... but his movements are
more and more parodically feminine for Gerda's entertainment.
The more he acts it, the more fun it is, until finally Gerda
scolds, still laughing:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             No, don't make her a slut!

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             It's your fault, you excite her.

Gerda gets close to pin him still.      His face closes on hers.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             You have no idea...

He falls on her, laughing, passionate... Gerda responds, but
grabs a cloth and wipes his made-up face as he kisses her.


<b>MONTAGE BEGINS -
</b>

<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM
</b>
We see Gerda's work around the room, now, depicting `Lili's'
progress. Einar, at the mirror, plucks his eyebrows to better
resemble the glamorous arch in Gerda's sketches.


<b>EXT. STREET OUTSIDE WIDOW HOUSE
</b>
Einar and Gerda walk, a little way apart. He feels his way
into her gait, she checks back on his progress.

<b>     EXT. HARBOUR, FISH STALL, DAY

     As Gerda buys fish, Einar is distracted, observing and
     copying the movements of the female customer beside him...


<b>     INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR
</b>
     Gerda and Einar arrive.   The stage doorman nods.

<b>                         EINAR

</b>               Good morning.


<b>     INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, DAY
</b>
     Gerda and Einar try on wigs, surreptitious, excited, adjust
     one another's choices. Then, a long line of almost identical
     shoes, beginning in tiny sizes but gradually getting bigger.
     Einar grabs the last - biggest - pair. When he looks up,
     Gerda's showing him a dress...


<b>     INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
</b>
     Einar and Gerda head out past the stage doorman, very pleased
     with themselves. Gerda is several sizes fatter and taller -
     she wears a wig with a hat on top. Hands stuffed into coat
     pockets hide bulky shoes. Thorbjorn looks up briefly from
     his newspaper. Then as the door closes behind Einar and
     Gerda, he looks up again - ?

<b>     - MONTAGE ENDS -

<b>     INT. WIDOW HOUSE, EVENING
</b>
     The Lili sketches depict a gamut of moods, face and posture
     already becoming iconic. Einar in the slip and the new
     shoes, practising his walk to settle his nerves. Hears the
     front door open - quickly calls:

<b>                         EINAR
</b>               I wondered where you were, it's getting
               late.

     Gerda comes in...

<b>                         GERDA
</b>               We have plenty of time.     I bought these...

     Einar takes the stockings with interest. Gerda watches,
     entertained at his enthusiasm, but a little apprehensive..

             Einar, are you sure about tonight?

Einar looks up, surprised. Nods, without hesitation.
Gerda's a little taken aback at his enthusiasm.


<b>EXT. STREET NEAR CANAL, NEAR ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, NIGHT
</b>
Dancing light and sound - up ahead, we see a glamorous,
eclectic gathering: the fun-loving, the arrogant, the
eccentric, the bourgeois - all rubbing shoulders on their
way to the Royal Academy.

Two pairs of women's feet in step: Gerda and Einar, approach
the melee. Then Gerda realises Einar has slowed, dropped
back behind her. She turns to see him transformed in a
chiffon dress with a linen sailor's collar and cuffs...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             What is it...?

Einar's eyes shine animated. He cuts an ungainly figure, but
the impression is more confusing than jarring.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Am I pretty enough?

Gerda's surprised by the sincerity of the question.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Of course you are...

He takes Gerda's hand and she pulls closer.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I'll never be as pretty as you.

Gerda studies the features, the fire behind the eyes. An
intensity she had not been expecting... something new... A
charged moment... Gerda's genuinely moved... but then
Einar/Lili laughs, breaks away... leaving Gerda with a beat
of emotion that doesn't belong anywhere.


<b>INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, STAIRCASE, NIGHT
</b>
Gerda and `Lili' mingle with the crowd.    A VOICE rings out:

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             My darling!

A flicker of fear in Lili... until Gerda interposes herself:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Ulla, let me introduce...

Ulla's eyes snag for a moment as they search the familiar
face and realisation dawns. Delight floods her face. Then:

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             It's Lili...!

<b>                       GERDA

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             My dear, you're exquisite...

She LAUGHS, thrilled, exchanges a look with Gerda. Lili's
eyelashes flutter, a picture of shyness as Ulla summons the
rest of her party - revelling in their shared secret...

                       ULLA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             In - let's go in...

Gerda and Lili - holding hands - join the crush:

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             You won't leave me, will you...?

Gerda looks down at Einar/Lili's grip on her hand.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>                 (sincerely)
             No. No, never.

She squeezes the hand and they press forward together.


<b>INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
</b>
A spectacular event. An orchestra plays and people dance.
Ulla's party drink and laugh. Gerda and Lili hang back a
little, observing. There's a circle of men in tuxedos nearby.
One glances across at Lili. Lili looks away, blushing.

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             People are looking.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Well you're a pretty girl, you'll
             have to get used to that.

But she sees Lili's really uncomfortable.

                       GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             It's fine. You're just feeling
             self-conscious.

</b>             Go. I'll be fine. Go before she
             comes over here...

Gerda reluctantly crosses the room and greets Elsa warmly.
But by the time she glances back, Lili has gone.

Lili sits at the edge of the dancefloor on a bench carved
with mermaids, a nerve fluttering in her cheek. We see a
young man, HENRIK SANDAHL, study her closely - closely enough
to see she is not everything she appears, but this only seems
to intrigue him. He sits beside her. Lili self-consciously
takes a notebook from her bag, begins to jot things down.
Henrik leans in, his raven hair in Lili's peripheral vision,
leans forward until Lili's refusal to engage becomes comical.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Are you a reporter?

Lili looks up.

<b>                         EINAR/LILI
</b>                   (flatly)
             No.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             A poetess...?

Lili packs up the notebook and hurries away... Finds a
corridor, leading off the hall - quieter, darker...

Lili feels her way along the wall, relieved to be in the
cooler air, away from the party. As her eyes adjust to the
darkness, she sees a couple kissing in an alcove. A flash of
the woman's white thigh, as the man pushes up her dress.
Lili turns away, discomfited, walks straight back into
Henrik.

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Do you know the story of this oak
             tree?

<b>                         EINAR/LILI

Einar's reaction flashes through Lili's facade.

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             Why would they say that...?

Henrik bows, entertained by the effect he's had...

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.

A moment's hesitation, then:

<b>                        EINAR/LILI
</b>             Lili...

<b>                       HENRIK

<b>                       EINAR/LILI

<b>                       HENRIK

Lili hesitates, turns back:

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             Einar Wegener. He's a painter.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Rather a good one.   Better than
             most people think.

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             Is that right?

<b>                        EINAR/LILI

She makes to leave again, but:

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Don't go back in. It's cooler
             here. Besides, I'm a romantic.

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             I think you might be the same.

Henrik holds out his hand. Lili looks at it, a sense of
connection she can't understand, previously unimaginable...
Then, trembling, Lili reaches out and rests her delicate,
manicured hand in Henrik's... and suddenly her nerves are
completely steady. Henrik leads Lili along the corridor,
away from the hall...


<b>INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
</b>
Noisier and smokier now, too much aquavit drunk, the guests a
little out of focus. Gerda scans the dishevelled crowds,
concerned - no sign of Lili. Suddenly, Ulla's at her side.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Have you seen Einar? I can't find
             him.

<b>                       ULLA
</b>             Of course you can't, he isn't here!

Ulla and Gerda laugh... Ulla raises her glass... more fun!
But Gerda excuses herself, and continues looking...


<b>EXT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, LIFE-DRAWING ROOM, NIGHT
</b>
Lili and Henrik sit on a bench in the lee of a sculpted
classical nude. Lili's cheeks burn. Henrik is clearly
fascinated. The slight sense of playacting between them only
heightens their excitement.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             You're different from other girls.

Lili scoffs gently.

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             That's not a very original line.

<b>                          HENRIK
</b>             It's true.     You're old fashioned.

Lili takes Henrik in, decides to continue...

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             Provincial. I'm new to the city.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             No, it's more than that. I feel
             I'd need to ask permission before I
             kissed you.

A bolt of something goes through Lili. Her eyes sink, drawn
and repulsed, to Henrik's lips. She can hardly breathe...

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             I probably ought to find Gerda.

She heads back toward the corridor... Henrik grabs her hand.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Why don't you tell her I'll walk
             you home...?

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             She wouldn't like that...

He advances, his body pressing against her, commanding,
holding her fixed in the doorway...

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Lili...

Lili pulls away, flustered, aroused...

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             Einar might be waiting up... he
             wouldn't like this...

<b>                       HENRIK

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             Lili...

He steadies her... repeating her name...

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Lili... Lili.

Three times a charm... We see something shift in Lili...
Henrik senses it... He kisses her. When he releases her she
gasps, and he kisses her again, finds his passion returned
this time... When she finally catches her breath she can't
look at him...

<b>                       EINAR/LILI
</b>             You didn't ask permission...

<b>                       HENRIK

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Standing in the corridor, by the oak, Gerda watches, stunned,
as Lili clutches Henrik's arm, looks suddenly faint, upset...
Lili looks down, confused and then panicked. Blood pours
from her nose, down the front of her dress... she's appalled.

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             What's happened..? Let me...

Henrik tries to find a handkerchief... Then sees Gerda
approaching... He pulls away from Lili...

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             I'm sorry I don't know what...

Lili holds out her arms to Gerda. Henrik steps back... Gerda
reaches Lili, quickly takes her weight... Gerda wraps her
scarf around `Lili', who now looks like Einar in grotesque
drag, smeared with make-up and blood.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Quickly, lean on me...

Henrik watches, and onlookers stare as Gerda supports Einar
out of the ball... They stumble, clinging together, ashamed.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, NEXT MORNING
</b>
Einar paints.    In a smart male suit.   He is stiffly composed.

Gerda comes into the studio, in her nightclothes. Finds
Einar deeply immersed. No trace of the night's upset.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             How are you...?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             You were late home last night, I
             thought I'd let you sleep. How was
             it? Did Lili have fun?

Gerda's stunned.     Goes to the kitchen, upset.

In the kitchen, Lili's bloodied clothes are soaking in a
bucket. Gerda struggles with the sight. Begins to make
coffee, then...

Gerda returns to the studio, watches Einar, anger building.
He allows it a while, then turns, braced to face her:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I think it would be better if Lili
             didn't come here again.

<b>                        EINAR
</b>             Fine.   I understand.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You know what I would like to
             understand?

Einar takes Gerda in... how furious, how shaken she looks.

                       GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Exactly what happened between you
             and Sandahl last night?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>                 (quickly)
             Nothing.

Gerda HUFFS, disbelieving.        Einar repeats himself, angrily:

                       EINAR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             It was nothing.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Did he know it was you?

Einar blushes, shies away.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             It wasn't as simple as that.     It's
             hard to explain...

Gerda loses control, shouts at him:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
             could you please make an effort?!

Einar's shocked, ashamed.        He takes stock, then quietly:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             He may have known who I was. But I
             wasn't always... me. There was a
             moment when I was... just Lili.
             And I think he could see that. Do
             you see?

Gerda struggles to comprehend this shift in the landscape.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             But Lili doesn't exist.     We made
             her up.

<b>                         EINAR
</b>             I know...

<b>                       GERDA

</b>
Gerda's mind reels, panic rises...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             This is absurd. We need to stop.
             Make it stop Einar.

With genuine anxiety:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I'm going to try...

She goes, still distressed, leaving Einar alone.


<b>EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, TWO WEEKS LATER
</b>
The Chinese Laundress RINGS her tiny BELLS along the street.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
</b>
The Lili portraits are gone. Einar regards a canvas. Failing
to paint. In the kitchen, Gerda chops vegetables, throws
them in a pan. She hovers in the doorway to the studio.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Another headache?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             It's nothing...

She goes back into the kitchen again...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Can I get you something?

<b>                         EINAR
</b>             I'm fine.

Gerda returns to chopping.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Maybe you should see a doctor.

Einar grows agitated.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Gerda... I'm fine.

Gerda looks round to see Einar now in his coat. He quickly
collects a small suitcase, goes out, leaving Gerda to fret.


<b>EXT. OPERA HOUSE, DAY
</b>
No lights on, no signs of life.

</b>

<b>INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
</b>
Einar passes through, nods amiably to the familiar doorman.


<b>INT. COSTUME SHOP, DAY
</b>
Einar turns on the lights, quickly pulls off his coat.    He
leans forward, bracing against the bench, looks in the
mirror. There's a desperation about him. But now he sees:
the front of his shirt gapes - reveals a cleavage, formed by
his rounded shoulders. Einar is compelled... nervously
unbuttons his shirt to the waist and leans forward again.
The effect is startling. He traces the shape of his
`breasts' with trembling hands.

With a new urgency, he quickly strips off shirt, trousers,
terrified that someone might catch him, yet driven to press
on. He pulls off his underwear, returns to the mirror, pushes
his cock back between his legs, squeezing his thighs tight
until he has an approximation of a vagina. He rounds his
shoulders, takes in the arresting transformation, breathless
with excitement, terror. A sense of impending inevitable
transgression.

He opens his case. A carefully folded silk package unfurls
into a dress, brushes against his skin.


<b>INT. STUDIO, DAY
</b>
Gerda sits in the chair looking out of the window, face set
against terror, her sketchbook closed in her lap, brooding,
pressure building. She opens the sketchbook: Lili...


<b>INT CAFE ON CANAL, DAY
</b>
Einar/Lili arrives inside a cafe, pushes back a headscarf. We
see Henrik waiting at a table. He quickly stands when he
spots Lili - who is consumed with shyness, real fear.

<b>                    HENRIK
</b>          I didn't think you'd come.

Lili settles in her seat.

<b>                     EINAR/LILI
</b>          No.   Nor did I.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, LATER
</b>
Gerda begins to sketch, almost afraid to begin. But her
energy gathers and there is soon anger and desire in the work
as she conjures a Lili with dark erotic potential, a frenzied
relationship with the subject developing...


<b>                                                26/11/15

<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, EVENING
</b>
Gerda lies on the chaise, exhausted. Hears the door, doesn't
move. Einar appears, in his overcoat. After a moment:

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          I thought you might not come back.

<b>                    EINAR
</b>          That's absurd...

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          Is it?

Einar can hardly bear the question... feels terrible, wraps
his arms around her. Then sees, at an angle, in the half-
light, the new Lili picture. A nude with female hips and
breasts. A slash of red mouth. A cigarette.


<b>INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, A MONTH LATER, DAY
</b>
A door opens and Gerda sits up - a THIN YOUNG MAN appears.

<b>                    THIN YOUNG MAN
</b>          He won't be much longer.

Gerda sits back, too pessimistic to feel nervous.


<b>INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, HALF AN HOUR LATER

Rasmussen studies a series of Gerda's portraits, his mouth
puckered with poorly disguised distaste. Gerda steels
herself to withstand the humiliation.

<b>                    RASMUSSEN
</b>          I just... I don't know...

And then he sees the Lili nude. He's suddenly intrigued...

          The model...?

<b>                    GERDA

Rasmussen licks his lips, excited but uncertain...

</b>             These are different... For these, I don't
             know... there may be a market.

Gerda has to confirm what she's heard:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You're taking them.

<b>                       RASMUSSEN
</b>             Well, yes...

He's surprised as she is.


<b>EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
</b>
Lili hurries past the endless orange facades of a long row of
terraced houses, Gerda's embroidered wrap flying in the wind
behind her. Knocks at a door, breathless...


<b>INT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
</b>
Henrik welcomes Lili at the open door...

<b>                          HENRIK
</b>             Come in...

He closes the door against the world. Lili takes in the
space. She's delighted by it -

<b>                        LILI
</b>             I don't have long... Gerda's seeing
             Rasmussen.

Henrik gestures for Lili to sit.      She settles on the couch.

<b>                       HENRIK
</b>             I don't like all these lies.

<b>                       LILI

<b>                       LILI

Lili lets herself be drawn closer to him... He strokes her
face. Lili smiles, adoring. Henrik kisses her and she
responds eagerly. His hand works its way down her body,
between her legs. Lili squirms, uncomfortable. He
persists... Lili bears it as long as she can, then gently:

<b>                       LILI

Still in the moment of passion...

<b>                        HENRIK

Lili recoils, stunned... astonished...

But Lili pushes him away, upset, bewildered...

Henrik's frustrated.

</b>             Yes... wait... Wait!      Lili... Lili, come
             back...

But Lili bolts, away and out through the front door, leaving
Henrik powerless, bereft.


<b>EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
</b>
Lili rushes away, disorientated, along the row of garish
facades, their orange now seeming grotesque...


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, DAY
</b>
Gerda struggles in with her portfolio. Heads for the kitchen,
preoccupied by her experience with Rasmussen, is taken aback
to see Lili at the table, Gerda's embroidered wrap pulled
tight about her. Then Lili looks round - her face swollen and
streaked with tears.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>                 (concerned)
             Are you alright...?

Lili reaches out her hand and Gerda takes it...

<b>                         EINAR/LILI
</b>             No...

She holds Gerda at arms length.       Takes a deep breath.

                       EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
             I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.

Gerda reels, speechless as Lili clatters out, stumbling to
the bedroom. Closes the bedroom door.


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, KITCHEN, 20 MINUTES LATER
</b>
Gerda sits - waiting. Finally, Einar comes back, in male
clothing. Looks devastated.

<b>                       EINAR

             No.

He nods.   Gerda's desperate confusion surfaces:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             So... are you in love with Sandahl?

Einar's appalled:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             No - I love you, Gerda, only you. But
             Lili...

Angry tears well in Gerda's eyes.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Why can't you just be honest about this!

But Einar's angry too...

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I'm trying! Gerda... please... I
             need you to believe me. You of all
             people to understand.

Gerda shakes her head, unable to take this in...      He looks at
her, desperate imploring... Gerda struggles:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik
             and `Lili' are together, they what...? They
             kiss - we know that...

Einar nods, awkward.    Gerda steels herself:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Has it gone beyond that?

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             No... No, Lili's never gone further than
             that with a man. She... she wouldn't...

Gerda hears the implication... a bodyblow for her:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             There have been other men?

Einar sits on the bed, bites down on something difficult:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             There was another, but it was a long time
             ago.

A chill runs through Gerda...    Einar gathers his courage.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             That boy Hans... back in Vejle.

Gerda rubs her brow... everything's happening too fast...

             Lili fell for him. And he kissed her. Just

Einar darkens at the memory:

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             But my father came in and he caught them...
             He knocked Hans down - he was so angry...

Einar shakes his head... Gerda absorbs this. She looks up -
Einar looks pale, dark circles under his eyes.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I don't know what to say.

He breathes suddenly, against pain...

                        GERDA (cont'd)
             What...?

His eyes close, sweat forming on his brow.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I'm so sorry...

He doubles over, clutching his stomach... moans horribly...

             I'm so sorry... I'm not feeling

He tries to get up from the table, struggles...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Einar... what is this?   What's happening...

She rushes to catch him as his legs give out under him...

Einar nods as he undresses.

<b>                          EINAR

             Mr Wegener I'm a specialist. You

Einar considers...

Hexler seeks to inject a rational note...

             That would explain the pain, the

             the infertility. Let's hope it is
             that, because that we can cure.

He switches on the bright examination lamp, places his palm
against Einar's lower abdomen.


<b>INT. RADIUM INSTITUTE, X-RAY ROOM, DAY
</b>
Einar is strapped to a hospital trolley by a couple of
nurses. Hexler watches through a window onto the room.
Einar grasps Gerda's hand, anxious, bewildered:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I don't need to do this...   There's

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Einar, that's not true.

The nurses nod to Gerda to leave.

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             This can't be right...

The nurses wait...

The nurses lead Gerda out... Einar takes in the alien
machinery of the room. She watches helplessly through a
tinted window as the X-ray machine begins to WHIRR. Hexler
speaks into a funnel:

<b>                       HEXLER (CONT'D)
</b>             Lie still, Mr Wegener...

The JUDDERING of the machine fills Einar's head... an

vanishes into himself.

             How are you feeling this morning?

Einar considers the question for a moment, then -

<b>                       EINAR

Hexler reads the distress in Einar's features.      Einar closes
his eyes again against the thought.

Gerda, in a hurry, stops to collect the mail from the foot of
the stairs. There's an art magazine, a personal letter,
then, underneath an envelope from The Radium Institute...
Hexler's name on the back. Gerda freezes, then quickly opens
it, reads: "no choice... treated for perversion...". She
struggles for a moment, panic rising, then folds the letter,
stuffs it in her jacket. A dark decision resolves itself in
Gerda's face...

Gerda steels herself:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             So. Is there anything to take care of
             before we go? Anyone you need to tell?

Einar considers a moment, then:

<b>                        EINAR
</b>             No.

Gerda nods, relieved. She kisses his cheek, resumes packing.
Einar concentrates on keeping breathing.


<b>EXT. PARIS BY NIGHT

A dazzling archetypal view of the Seine and its light-studded
bridges, the Cathedral of Notre Dame a bold silhouette in the
background. VOICES come up, an EXCITED SOCIAL SOUND.


<b>INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, NIGHT, 6 MONTHS LATER
</b>
An emphatically chic Parisian crowd admires a triumphant
series of Lili portraits - a couple that we saw at
Rasmussen's, and then several nudes, Lili imagined as an
anatomically correct woman. A small group gathers round
Gerda, their new star, and a still pale Einar.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Einar's a painter too...

</b>             I think my work is a little...
             introspective for French taste.

An ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN interrupts...

Einar rides it out.    Gerda doesn't miss a beat.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             No, she stayed behind in Denmark.

<b>                       ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN
</b>             Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.

Einar looks down, away, affected... Gerda's swept off by the
gallery owner, leaving Einar in the company of the paintings
of his own banished self.


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
</b>
Gerda and Einar in bed, close, tenderness on both sides.
Gerda gently kisses Einar, then begins to work her way down
his torso. He closes his eyes, wills himself to let this
happen... Gerda begins to fellate him... He struggles with
his breathing, intensely challenged

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             Gerda... please... I can't.

She continues... He's overwhelmed with panic, pushes her off.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No...

The attempt at intimacy is over, failed. Einar's full of
guilt, distress. Gerda's hurt, lost. Neither moves -
emotional paralysis.


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO,    - NEXT DAY
</b>
Gerda works on a self-portrait. Einar appears. Gerda
hurries, to greet him, summons a playful mood, born of
desperation.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Will you sit for me? Just as you
             are. We haven't done that since

He smiles.    She strokes his face, encouraged.

             The teacher suddenly at the mercy of the
             student. You found it exciting.

Gerda curls in to him.    He gently extricates himself.

Gerda feels ashamed, can't help herself:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I miss you. I miss you working beside me.

Einar hesitates, then admits:

<b>                       EINAR
</b>             I can't remember the landscape any more.      I
             can't remember Vejle.

Gerda struggles to adjust to this, then:

</b>             Well you could help me with this
             background. What does it need...?

Einar looks at the painting, can hardly pull it into focus...

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             An kettlehole lake? A farmhouse, far off?                  *

He gently stops her -

</b>             Gerda...

He's not going to do it.        Turns away, goes out.


<b>INT/EXT. PARIS APARTMENT
</b>
Gerda watches from the window: Einar in the street below, on
through the crowds until he's out of sight.


<b>EXT. RUE DE NUIT, DAY
</b>
Different part of town, different atmosphere. Prostitutes on
the corner CLUCK indulgent as Einar passes. He looks self-
consciously about, enters a dingy house as another man comes
out. They barely acknowledge one another.


<b>INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, 1ST FLOOR LANDING, DAY
</b>
A hatch in a door slides open, and MADAME CARTON's eyes flash
greedily from behind an iron grille.


<b>INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, ROOM NO. 3, DAY
</b>
The tiny room contains a chair and a bin. We hear GROANS from
an adjoining room. There are two small windows with black
shades drawn. Einar settles, slowly lifts one of the shades.
Behind smudged glass, a worn-out girl in a corset and
stockings grinds against a chair, sullen. Beyond her, we see

another dark window, another man with his nose pressed
against it.

Einar studies the girl and gradually his body begins to
mirror hers, a parody of female abandon. We see his
reflection in the glass now, gradually eclipsing her... He
breathes, an almost orgasmic GASPING breath of relief.


<b>INT. HANS OFFICE, QUAI D'ORSAY, PARIS, A WEEK LATER, DAY
</b>
HANS AXGIL on the telephone. An impressively upholstered man,
quixotic, appealing. The emphatically masculine room - dark
wood infused with Hans' cigar smoke - overlooks a
breathtaking view of the Seine. A sense of space, freedom.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             Hey, he's playing with us!   He knows the
             price...

Hans laughs, shakes his head. A quiet KNOCK and a secretary
pulls a face around the door. Hans waves her away, impatient.

                       HANS (cont'd)
             Look, I have to go. I have some Danish girl
             waiting to see me. But tell him we'll find
             another buyer, no problem. He's always the
             same!


<b>INT. HANS AXGIL'S OFFICE, RECEPTION, DAY

Gerda's immediately on her feet, her strong right hand
stretched towards Hans, unavoidable. She's no girl.

</b>             Hans Axgil..

He shakes her hand, intrigued.    Gerda's a little over-eager.

Hans stops, surprised.      His secretary suppresses a smile.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             Let you speak?

Hans takes her in, the tough fragility of her.     Smiles.

                       HANS (cont'd)
             I'm a much better listener when I'm eating.

He nods goodbye to his secretary, shows Gerda the door.


<b>EXT. STREET NEAR HANS' OFFICE

They hurry along the street, approach the restaurant...

<b>                       HANS
</b>             Well, I don't know why Rasmussen
             gave you my number, but I'm happy

<b>                       GERDA

Hans smiles, encouraged. He holds open the door to a smart
brasserie. Gerda goes through ahead of him. As she does:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I believe you were a childhood
             friend of my husband.

Hans is left holding the door, alone.

The sommelier hurries away.     Hans studies Gerda.    Who is she?

<b>                       GERDA

Hans is amazed.

Hans is excited, a boy again. Gerda can't help it, blurts:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             He told me that you kissed him once.

Hans is taken aback...

<b>                       HANS
</b>             I what...??

But his amazement shifts as it comes back to him...

                       HANS (cont'd)
             Oh no! You're right... We were fooling
             in the kitchen. Einar was wearing his
             grandmother's apron...

Hans laughs, amazed at his younger self:

                       HANS (cont'd)
             We were just little boys, you know,
             playing around? Anyway, Einar just
             looked so pretty in that apron - I
             kissed him! Next thing I know, his
             father's chasing me out.

Hans shakes his head...

                       HANS (cont'd)
             God - Einar. Hey - why didn't he come
             today?

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             He doesn't know I'm here. I don't think
             he'd like me asking for help.

Hans' eyes flash, focused. This is what she's come for, then:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             We don't really know people here. And
             Einar's... he's lost his way. He's not
             working. He needs someone to represent
             him - someone who knows, him. He needs a
             friend.

Hans scrutinises Gerda, her pride at odds with her need. And
for the first time in her life, Gerda looks away, unable to
hold someone's gaze.

She finds him stretching a fresh canvas.   He scarcely pauses.

                    GERDA (cont'd)
          I've a new dealer coming over later.    I'd
          like you to meet him.

<b>                    EINAR

<b>                       LILI
</b>             I'm so sorry Einar couldn't be here. He
             told me: in Vejle you were his great
             friend. Both always plotting to getting
             away!

<b>                       HANS

<b>                       LILI
</b>             Such a tedious place! He said you'd sit
             and look out together, beyond the fjord..
             to the sea... to the future.

<b>                       HANS

<b>                        LILI

             in peace, who told him it was alright to be
             a painter.

Gerda returns to the room. Hans searches Lili's face for the
remains of his old friend Einar.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             He... used to sketch my portrait. Take a
             stone and draw me on the rocks at the side
             of the road.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I didn't know that.

<b>                        LILI
</b>             Oh yes.

Gerda turns to Hans:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Would you like to see more of Einar's
             work...?

<b>                       LILI
</b>             Do we have any?

Gerda's surprised, unsettled by the question.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Yes, of course, Lili...

<b>                       LILI

Gerda flinches, but:

                       LILI (cont'd)
             He doesn't mind, do you...?

Gerda looks helpless.     Hans takes over:

<b>                       LILI
</b>             I think marriage is the single thing we

<b>                          HANS
</b>             Really?

Lili looks utterly buoyant...

<b>                       LILI
</b>             It creates someone else, more than just the
             two of you. It would be terrible never to
             know that...

Her expression crumbles... Hans looks to Gerda...

<b>                          GERDA
</b>             Lili...

Lili's dissolving...

<b>                          LILI
</b>             Excuse me.

She hurries out towards the bedroom, clearly in distress.
Hans struggles to comprehend the situation...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You... you ought to go...

<b>                       HANS
</b>             No - let me help...

She turns, holds Hans' hands... the intimacy, intensity of
connection surprises him:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Please - please - I'm sorry...

He resigns himself to leaving... as he reaches the door:

<b>                       HANS

<b>                       LILI (O.S.)
</b>             Goodnight...

Hans lets himself out.

In the bedroom, Gerda, still shocked, looks at Lili -
bewildered, afraid, head hanging.

                       LILI (cont'd)
             I don't think he noticed anything, do you?

<b>                          GERDA
</b>             Sleep now.     We'll talk more tomorrow.

<b>                       LILI
</b>             Can I borrow a nightdress?

Gerda's shocked.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             No... we've never done that.     Lili's never
             spent the night...

Einar confesses:

<b>                       LILI
</b>             It doesn't matter what I wear. When I
             dream, they're Lili's dreams...

Gerda struggles to accommodate this, very reluctant... but
she gives in, nods. What else can she do?


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, LATER
</b>
Gerda in bed. Lili's sleeping head on the pillow next to
her, where Einar's once was. Gerda turns out the light.


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, DAY
</b>
Gerda arrives to find Lili in a bright dress with matching
scarf. Shopping bags everywhere. Slight tension in the air.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             A new dress...

<b>                          LILI
</b>             And this.     Do you like it?

She hands Gerda a bright scarf...

<b>                        GERDA
</b>             Yes.   It's perfect for you...

Gerda hands it back.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             We're actually a little short of money at
             the moment.

Lili hangs the scark back round Gerda's neck, hardly misses a
beat:

             for you again, can't I...?   That
             worked well before, Gerda, didn't
             it...?

Lili and Gerda take each other in, on a new footing...


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, DAY - MONTAGE
</b>
Gerda paints Lili who has found a new stillness. A more
serious spirit beneath the translucent skin. A sense of her
growing into herself.

We see on the wall now a number of double portraits, telling
the story of a developing negotiation - Gerda and Lili
depicted together, with a sense of close friendship or a
wistful attempt at coupledom.

Now Gerda paints with Lili advising... The two
collaborating, a sense of shared vision.

And throughout, we see Lili fully imagined as a woman, and an
increasingly idealised one - unrealistically lovely...


<b>INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, RAINY NIGHT, ONE MONTH LATER
</b>
Another show of `Lili' paintings. A lot of the paintings of
the two as a couple, but Gerda is here alone. She feels it.
She works the room, determined, then sees Hans, across the
crowd. Misses a beat. They make their way toward one
another. An awkward social kiss. Gerda's unusually brittle.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             It's a good crowd.

<b>                       GERDA

             coming.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             Thank you for asking me.   I thought you'd
             forgotten all about me.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Einar hates this kind of thing.

</b>             Is he well...?

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             He's excited. We have an old friend coming
             to town: Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. Do
             you know her?

<b>                       HANS
</b>             I don't think so. Could I take you to
             dinner? To celebrate? Someone ought to.

<b>                        GERDA
</b>             No.   Thank you.

Hans absorbs this, regroups.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             Gerda, have I offended you?

<b>                        GERDA
</b>             No.

<b>                        HANS
</b>             Gerda...

He rests his hand on her arm, pressing for some honesty...
Gerda's cornered, the heat of the room, the nearness of Hans.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I am still Einar's wife.

She brushes past him, into the crowd.       A MAN'S VOICE calls:

<b>                        MAN
</b>             Hans!

Hans' social mask slips quickly back into place.

Later: CLOSE ANGLE on Gerda, watching as a flirtatious woman
WHISPERS something in Hans' ear. His eyes widen, he LAUGHS.
Gerda looks away. Quickly sets down her drink and moves
through the crowd toward the door...

A GALLERY EMPLOYEE frets as Gerda pulls on her coat.

<b>                       GALLERY EMPLOYEE
</b>             At least take an umbrella...

But Gerda's out in the rain, the party still in full swing.

Gerda lets herself in, breathless. Lili's just arranging a
supper table, is surprised to see Gerda home so early...

<b>                       LILI
</b>             Gerda...? Oh - you're wet through.

Gerda seems angry.    Lili tries to stay buoyant...

             Did it go well...? Tell me - how

<b>                       LILI

</b>             Stop playing that stupid, stupid

Gerda is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion -

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I need to see Einar.

Lili flinches, shakes her head, touches Gerda, tender.

<b>                       LILI
</b>             Let me help...

Gerda cuts her off sharply, desperation building:

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I need my husband.   Just get him!

<b>                          LILI

Lili's eyes cloud.    Gerda moderates, already losing hope...

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I want to talk to my husband.   I want to
             hold my husband. I need him.    Can you get
             him? Can you at least try?

Lili's pained by the request. Her eyes     plead, but Gerda's
desperate, won't give up. Finally Lili     shakes her head,
desperately sorry. Gerda turns on her      heel. The front door
BANGS as she heads off into the night,     leaving Lili alone and
deeply sad.

Gerda sits in the dark, watching the rain on the pond.

Lili transitioning to Einar. It happens awkwardly, and when
Einar looks in the mirror, he's baffled by his reflection.

<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
</b>
Gerda appears in the doorway. Sees Einar sitting in the
chair by the bed. She's struck by how vulnerable he looks.
He looks up, and with genuine regret:

<b>                    EINAR/LILI
</b>          I don't think I can give you what you
          want...

He looks away, ashamed. It's unbearable. Gerda approaches
him. He looks like Lili dressed as Einar.

                    EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
          I don't know how long we can go on like
          this.

<b>                     GERDA
</b>          No.

She pushes in beside him. Einar/Lili lies in Gerda's lap.
They hold each other into the night.

Establishing shot.


<b>INT. OPERA GARNIER, STAGE, NEXT DAY
</b>
Einar watches a group of dancers rehearse on stage. Sitting
in the stalls, Gerda and Ulla are talking, as Ulla unbinds
her feet. We see callouses over the knuckles of her toes,
toenails broken and sore. She's used to this.

<b>                    ULLA
</b>          He needs to see someone.

Gerda checks Einar's well out of earshot.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          You know what happened with Hexler.

<b>                    ULLA
</b>          But he's so thin, Gerda...?   There's
          something wrong with him.

Gerda looks across at Einar.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          Lili watches her figure...

Ulla lowers her voice -

<b>                    ULLA

          Women's Clinic in Dresden.

Gerda's face changes as she hears what Ulla's telling her.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             He's interested in men like Einar. Men who
             are... different. Who are... confused.

Gerda's surprised.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             He's often in Paris.

Before Gerda can reply, Ulla is writing a name on a card -

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Just talk to him? It couldn't hurt, could
             it?

- "Prof. Kurt Warnekros". She gives the card to Gerda. Gerda      *
looks up at Einar. Finds him looking back, plainly exhausted.


<b>INT. PARIS APARTMENT, MORNING
</b>
Gerda has made coffee.    Einar comes in, dressed and with some
energy.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Oh good... you're awake... how do
             you feel?

Einar nods - pretty good.      She pours him coffee.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Come.

<b>                       EINAR

He pulls on a jacket.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             Where?

He recoils from the question.     Gerda gives up -

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I'm sorry - I don't know how to hold on to
             you any longer.

<b>INT. BIBLIOTEQUE NATIONALE, DAY
</b>
Einar at a desk piled high with books. He reads, driven,
fascinated. We see the books: The Normal and Abnormal Man, A
Scientific Study of Sexual Immorality...


<b>EXT. PARK, LATER
</b>
Einar makes his way through the park. He looks bizarre in
daylight, like a woman dressed as a man. He passes a couple
of rough-looking younger men. One HISSES under his breath:

<b>                       YOUNGER MAN
</b>          Lesbian...

Einar looks round, amazed, almost amused at the mistake...
when the men recognise that Einar is - in fact - a man, they
LAUGH, shocked. Einar keeps walking, conscious of the men
shadowing him, making silly obscene noises and comments.

Einar presses on, anger and anxiety building as the men
pursue. Now the men pull level with him, jostle, one moving
ahead and rubbing his crotch.

                    YOUNGER MAN (cont'd)
          You speak English? Are you a boy...

<b>                    YOUNGER MAN 2
</b>          Or a girl...?

The first Young Man leers and LAUGHS and then we suddenly see
his nose burst with blood as Einar's fist connects. The two
men are caught by surprise as he lashes out with terrific
energy, but they regroup and then Einar's down, fists and
feet flying, the men beating him furiously, until they
finally run away.

Animated discussion between Hans and another man.

Hans' secretary puts her head around the door. He glances
up, annoyed, but something in her face gives him pause.
Behind her, a man appears... A beat before Hans recognises
the badly swollen face.

             remove the male parts entirely.                     *
             The second - once you were strong                   *
             again - to construct a vagina.                      *

Gerda looks to Einar - Einar's rapt.                             *

                       WARNEKROS (cont'd)                        *
             An irreversible change, and a high                  *
             risk of failure, of infection,                      *
             complications.                                      *

Warnekros's hand waves through the air, suggesting the           *
worst...                                                         *

</b>             It's my only hope.                                  *

Gerda and Einar exchange a look.     Warnekros observes.

<b>                       WARNEKROS
</b>             I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.

He warns them, an unmistakably serious tone:

             Mrs Wegener, I do believe I can                     *

<b>EXT. TRAIN STATION, MORNING
</b>
A NOISY bustling platform. People rushing in all directions.
Einar checks his ticket, about to board the train. Hans and
Gerda are with him, almost swept away by the tide of people.
Hans carries his case. They find a space in the crowd.
Einar strains at his starched collar - his suit is
emphatically masculine.

<b>                    EINAR
</b>          I feel strange going dressed like this.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          It's important. Hans says the Germans will
          check your papers.

<b>                    HANS
</b>          Don't take any chances.       You're nearly
          there.

Hans and Einar embrace, then Hans holds him at arms length.

<b>                    EINAR
</b>          I won't be seeing you again.

<b>                    HANS
</b>          You know, I've only really liked a handful
          of people in my life and you've been two of
          them.

Einar half-laughs.   Hans twinkles.

                       HANS (cont'd)
          Take care.     Take care.                                     *

The men part. Hans withdraws. Einar turns to Gerda. What
can he say? They hold one another close, intensely private.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          I wish you'd let me come with you.

<b>                     EINAR
</b>          I can't.   You love Einar. And I have to let
          him go.

They kiss, an emotional parting.       She removes her bright
scarf.

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          Here, take this...

He takes it, smiles, and boards the train - just in time.
The air fills with steam and NOISE. Gerda raises her hand to
wave as the train pulls out, carrying Einar away. Einar
fights tears as he moves off... Gerda runs alongside a
little way, the gap that's opening between them suddenly
unbearable. And then... the train has gone. Gerda turns to
leave, finds Hans waiting. She walks past him, bereft.

      She barely turns, hands stuffed firmly in her pockets.

<b>                             GERDA
</b>                   I'm going to walk.

      She strides down the platform, trying to outpace the pain,
      face set, body strong. She could walk like this forever.

      Einar watches the scenery fly by outside.

</b>
      Gerda prepares a fresh canvas.


<b>      INT. TINY BATHROOM ON TRAIN.
</b>
      Einar opens a document - his passport.       Takes a long look -

<b>                             GUARD (O.S.)

<b>      INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, DAY
</b>
      Gerda, charcoal in hand, the canvas before her, waits to
      begin. Then there's a swift line on the canvas - the curve
      of a flank - conjures a nude Einar or Lili... Whatever name
      is attached to it now. She sketches the form of a body she
      loves. Strong magic to keep it from harm.


<b>      EXT. STREET, DRESDEN, AFTERNOON

      Lili walks into town, a high road that gives her a panoramic
      view of the river.

Lili sits with Professor Warnekros. Behind him, anatomical

Lili amidst other young women patients, many pregnant. She
concentrates on balancing a teacup on her knee. A VOICE:

Lili looks round.       A delicate blonde, URSULA, sits nearby.

Later - Lili at the sink, wipes a washcloth over her face.
The water runs a peachy colour as powder and rouge rinse
away. Lili looks in the mirror at Einar for the last time.

tongue.

nurse administers morphine, another soothes.

The nurse slips a mask over Lili's face. She sucks

herself, moves the nurse aside, takes hold of the mask.

      Lili salutes like a girl guide.       Gerda marvels at her... so
      alive.

      Lili makes her way down the street, her confidence slowly

Lili at work.    She explains to an older female customer:

<b>                       LILI
</b>             And in Paris, a lady would never
             dream of spraying the scent
             directly onto herself.

The woman listens, entranced by Lili's animated lecture.

                       LILI (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             No, you spray the air, see, and
             walk into it...

Lili skips into the mist of scent.

                          LILI (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Voila..!

Lili skips into the mist of scent.

                          LILI (cont'd)
             You try...

The woman is shy, but Lili's enthusiasm is so infectious...

Later: Lili rearranges the perfume bottles on the counter
until they are perfectly aligned... a real satisfaction in
the aesthetic endeavour.

Lili and her colleagues pour out of the store, demob-happy.
Lili offers them sweets from her handbag.

And Lili rejoins the throng.

Lili walks along the canals, savouring the journey. The sun
sparkles on the water, and all around people are meeting and
talking, a world of life that she finally feels part of...


<b>INT. WIDOW HOUSE, GERDA'S SIDE OF THE ROOM, NIGHT
</b>
A quiet, dreamy atmosphere. Gerda lies awake, watches Lili's
lamplit silhouette on the other side of the dividing sheet.
Lili writes in her notebook. After a while:

             the strangest dream.

Gerda waits in the silence for some response.

Lili's silhouette waits a moment, then lies back down. Gerda
curls into herself.

Lili passes the cafe on the Harbour as usual, glances over...
Her footsteps slow... Sitting alone at a table is a familiar
face: Henrik looks up from his newspaper: Lili. He looks
shocked... then delighted...

looks up from reading. Lili takes a pill, resumes writing.

Gerda passes the fish stall, greets the female fishmongers -

Gerda shakes her head, disbelief...

Gerda's mind races to absorb the announcement...

Lili bites down on it:

Lili goes to hand over Gerda's scarf, but:

</b>             You keep it. For now.

Lili smiles, a little mischievous.       But then a look between
them. Gerda's afraid.

<b>                       LILI

Gerda nods, determined to believe it.

Lili is determinedly bright. Gerda takes her coat and bag.
The door closes behind her. A couple of moments pass and
then Lili begins to dissolve, releasing tears of overwhelming
fear and anticipation...

The CONCIERGE approaches, solicitous.

<b>                          GERDA
</b>             Room 9.

The concierge turns to get Gerda's key. The sound of a
cocktail piano in an adjacent room serves to reinforce her
isolation. But then she sees reflected in the mirror - a
familiar face -

                          GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Gerda turns, barely holding herself together... he catches
her in a heavy, passionate embrace. A huge sense of relief,
reunion, trust.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             It's alright.

Gerda nods, greatly comforted by his presence.

Warnerkros, scrubbed in, serious, ready to begin.

Lili anaesthetised. We stay on her face, hear voices, the
clank of instruments. Rain beginning... the sound of it
increasingly intense as the wind comes up too...


<b>INT. WARNEKROS'S CLINIC, RECEPTION, NEXT MORNING

Morning light streams in, harsh, unforgiving. Hans holds the
door for Gerda. She's barely inside when the Receptionist
jumps urgently to her feet.

off. He'll wait. Gerda hurries away.

They arrive at the doorway to Lili's room. Warnekros shows           *
Gerda in. Lili sleeps fitfully, slick with sweat.                    *
Warnekros's clearly worried. Gerda's astonished at how ill
she looks.

                       WARNEKROS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                 (deeply regretful)
             I'm sorry... I have to be honest.
             The prognosis is not...

He can't finish, but Gerda barely hears him anyway...

             alone.

Gerda hangs in the doorway, blocking it, until Warnekros is          *
obliged to turn away. We follow him, walking back down the           *
corridor, alone, excluded, burdened by failure.                      *

Heavy spots of rain begin to splash down. Most of the

Gerda in the chair at Lili's bedside, mopping her brow. The
rainstorm beating outside. A nurse enters with a jug of
water. Gerda nods, grateful.

Lili sleeping, calmer now. Her face translucent in the
morning light. Gerda sleeps in the chair beside her. Gerda
wakes, disoriented for a moment, then looks at Lili, sleeping
peacefully, clearly cooler now... Gerda feels her brow - no
heat there any more...   Gerda's relief is palpable. She
smooths Lili's fringe, then gets up, opens the curtains -
wide - the sun just starting to show in the rain-washed sky.
She turns back to see Lili's eyes open.

<b>                        GERDA

Lili struggles to speak.

in... thrilled to see her awake...

<b>                         HANS
</b>             Oh, Lili.    How are you?

Her voice is faint, cracked.      She takes in Hans and Gerda:

<b>                       LILI
</b>             I am... entirely myself.

Hans laughs gently.

<b>                       HANS
</b>             I'll tell Warnekros she's awake.

Hans goes.    Gerda sits back beside Lili, fixes her hair.

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             You know you had us worried...

Lili's frail, otherworldly, but her eyes burn bright.      She
looks to the window.

<b>                       LILI

<b>                       GERDA
</b>             I think you should rest...

But Lili takes Gerda's hand, a great sense of calm in her.
She looks at Gerda. Gerda still there, always there.

<b>                         LILI
</b>             Please...


<b>EXT. CLINIC GARDENS
</b>
Gerda wheels Lili out in a wheelchair, Hans holding the door
open for her to pass. A glance between him and Gerda, then
he leaves the women alone.

Gerda is settles herself in a chair beside Lili, rests her
hand on Lili's arm. The birch trees in Spring leaf. A light
breeze makes them quiver. Lili's breathing is shallow. We
feel the depth of love between the women, and the
precariousness of their situation.

Gerda struggles to remain composed.

             I'm sorry you were frightened.
             There's nothing to be afraid of any

Gerda is amazed, deeply moved...

<b>                        GERDA

Lili's features arrange themselves into an expression of
perfect joy as she sinks back into something which Gerda
gradually sees is deeper than sleep...

Gerda clutches the hand... No response...       Smooths the
brow... still nothing...

Gerda presses Lili's hand against her cheek, overwhelmed with
grief. Lili looks blissfully happy. The dawn light grows
stronger in the garden...


<b>INT/EXT. JUTLAND, DAWN, TWO WEEKS LATER
</b>
Hans' car rolls into the bleak landscape. Hans and Gerda
inside. Gerda looks out - at a landscape she knows with
absolute intimacy, although she's never been here before.
It's all here... the imagery from Einar's paintings, singing
with life... A wild stretch of rocky green under soft
northern light, a row of beautiful black-limbed trees, bent
over, but not broken, by the wind...

<b>EXT. CLIFFS OVERLOOKING KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, MORNING
</b>
Hans tails Gerda. She battles the incredible gusts of salt
air, the bright scarf flying like a flag at her throat. She
pushes on, closer to the cliff edge... Finally she reaches
an amazing vantage point, is stunned by the view: a rectangle
of ferociously stormy sea, silver waves whipped by a wind
that stings, relentless. We hear the RUSTLE and PUNCH of the
weather going at her. Hans joins her. They stand there
looking out until they can hardly breathe any more.

Hans takes her armto steady her, but as she turns toward him
the wind rips up under the bright scarf, snatches it into the
air. Gerda GASPS - a moment of loss - but then, something
else... As Hans hurries to try and catch it -

<b>                    GERDA
</b>          No - leave it..!   Leave it..

She pulls him back, watches it dance, tears of joy in her
eyes...

<b>                    GERDA (CONT'D)
</b>          Let it fly...

The scarf swoops up and dives down, curls and rolls, as free
as child... a girl at play. Gerda clutches her coat at her
breast, almost delirious at the beauty of it. Hans watches
with her - the absurdly joyous spectacle of it, a stunning
farewell. And as the scarf dances out from the cliff, out to
sea... into eternity...
